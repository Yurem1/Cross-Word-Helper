# Word Search Helper
###  *The app that **solves** your problems.* 
## Introduction 
As a High School student, many teachers love to assign students crossword puzzles, which can be very overwhelming and sometimes very difficult to finish, so I came up with a solution. You can have more time for other activities with this tool, whether it is a more important assignment at class, or you just wanna spend time with your phone, you won't have to worry about puzzles no more.
